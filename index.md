¡Bienvenidos! Welcome to our course: Digital Literacy through Cultural and Literary Topics!! 

This is the official website for our Fall 2025 course, built in connection with our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dh-miami/SPA_410_Fall25/). Here, you will find our syllabus, readings, digital resources, and the students' contributions. Throughout the semester, students will publish and share their work here as part of a collaborative, hands-on learning experience.

This year’s theme is *Digital Approaches to Life Writing*. We will read autobiographical and biographical texts—from medieval manuscripts to contemporary voices—and use digital tools to analyze, visualize, and interpret them. Together, we’ll investigate how people across history have narrated their lives and how digital humanities can reshape the way we read, explore, and understand these narratives.

Make yourself at home!! This is your space to learn, create, and experiment!!
