The design of the website is user-friendly and easy to navigate. It is organized with six tabs that are clearly labeled to indicate where they navigate to. A search bar is also included if there is something specific that the user wants to locate. A home page is included, but not clearly indicated- it is accessed by clicking on the logo on the top left corner, however there is no way of knowing that the logo also serves as a button to the homepage. There is a clear and intuitive mechanism of organization within each tab; for instance, the “people” tab is grouped by women, translators, royalty, prominent figures, etc. and the images tab is grouped by type of resource/artifact (painting, sculpture, document) in the image. The images have a useful and cool feature where each image lists the people/figures depicted and, upon hovering over the person listed, they are highlighted in the image. To further deepen the understanding of the image, the listed people are hyperlinked to biographical pages. The people tab also includes a timeline to better contextualize the times in which each person lived. The map type is quite random and its purpose is unclear. There are no links/buttons on the map, there is a search bar labeled “search features” but after typing numerous features (geographical and architectural), each time the search produced no results. 
The website features biographical life writing of people in Tibet, Inner Asia, and the Himalaya from the first few centuries of the common era to present day. While the writings aren’t written by the people themselves, their voices are still preserved as the biographies are written by highly educated historians who respect the respective culture and narrate the figures’ lives in a way that they would themselves (ex: “Go Lotsawa Zhonnu Pel passed into nirvana at the age of 90” instead of ‘passed away’).
