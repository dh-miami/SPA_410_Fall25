## Ejercicio 1: Érase una vez... yo 

================================

## Exercise 1: Once Upon a Me 

Deadline: 08-21-2025 (Before class)
Length: Approximately 1 paragraph (200 words)
To be submitted: As a Lab post via GitHub, <https://github.com/dh-miami/SPA_410_Fall25/tree/main/_posts>

### What to do:

To begin our exploration of life writing, we ask you to turn the lens inward. In this first exercise, write a short paragraph about yourself—your background, experiences, values, or aspirations—focusing on how you would choose to narrate your own life. This is not a formal biography or résumé, but rather a first-person reflection shaped by your own voice and priorities. The idea is to invite you to reflect on what it means to “write oneself” and prepares us to examine how others do the same—across different historical periods, cultures, and technologies.

## Some Guiding Questions:

- If your life were a story, what moment would you begin with?
- What details do you choose to include—and what do you leave out?
- How does your cultural, linguistic, or educational background influence the way you describe yourself?
- What tone do you adopt: humorous, serious, introspective, poetic?

## How to do it? 

1. Once you have created a your username in [GitHub](https://github.com/), you need to be added to our repository "SPA_410_Fall25" as a contributor. If you did not complete this step in class, just email us your username. 
2. In our main repo [SPA_410_Fall25](https://github.com/dh-miami/SPA_410_Fall25/tree/main) you will see the folder where all your assignments will be uploaded: [_posts](https://github.com/dh-miami/SPA_410_Fall25/tree/main/_posts) folder. In the upcoming weeks, you will learn how to work with GitHub via [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/), but right now, we will work directly in the web browser version of GitHub.  
3. For now, just let's copy the template that we have preapred for you: <https://github.com/dh-miami/SPA_410_Fall25/blob/main/_posts/2025-08-18-Exercise-1-template.md>. Go to "Raw" and copy paste everything. 
4. Then, go to "Add file"  and select "+ Create a new file". 54. Copy paste all the content from the template. 
5. Important: The name of the file should be date, "exercise-1", and surname. For the posts, the date is always indicated YYYY-MM-DD, meaning, for prof. Allés would be: `2025-08-18-Alles-Exercise-1`. Include the dashes, do not use spaces in name files.
6. The file starts with a heading or front matter (don't pay much attention to this right now), just change the name of the professor and the date.
7. Finally, click on "Commit changes."
